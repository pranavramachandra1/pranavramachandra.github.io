Web applications that tracks your workouts and progress.

I developed a web-app which tracks your workouts and workout programs. This was my first app-development project. This project has the following features:

* **Calendar**: track when you did your workouts. If you missed a workout, no worries! Switch the date and store your data.
* **Interactive Progress Tracker**: Track your workout volume on a per workout and per lift basis. Tracking your volume is the key to making progress in the weightroom.
* **Store Your Workout Programs**: Store your splits, and have the web-app remind you of your next workouts
* **Store Your Data**: Store and access your data through the interactive UI.

I used DigitalOcean as a database service to store user data, and I used Heroku as a service to deploy this small python web-app. I created some basic data structures, how to develop a REST-API, and some JSON-authentication for users to safely store their data.

Here are some views of the UI I developed, since I took this web page down. I uploaded an API that I personally use to log and track my data [here](https://github.com/pranavramachandra1/workout_api)!
