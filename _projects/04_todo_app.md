iOS Application that meets the needs of a real-world user!

I developed an iOS application which creates an interactable To-Do list!

**Features**
* Create and store your to-do lists!
* Create, or rollover (carry over unfinished tasks) into a new list for the user
* Tag tasks, and filter by tag (e.g. Personal, Work, etc.)
* Use google's Gemini to chat with a ChatBot that will analyze your task-completing capabilities!

I wanted a bettter app than the silly Reminders app, and was simple enough that it's practical. I also wanted to develop an iOS app just for the fun of it. Some features I plan on adding are:
* Schedule-add tasks to your to-do list: plan for a task to add itself to your list in the future
* Location based tasks: when you leave/enter a place, place a task into your list!
