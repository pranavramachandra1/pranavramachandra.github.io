Logistic regression model which predicts if an email is considered junk or not.

I created this model during Data 100 (Principles & Techniques to Data Science) as my intro to machine learning course. In this project, I conducted feature extraction, implemented sentiment analysis, and performed batch-regularization to increase the accuracy of this model, which is about 86%.

Overall, really enjoyed this project, and this was an excellent introduction to machine learning!
