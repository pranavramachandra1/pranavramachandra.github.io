Java application which runs a fun & interactive game where you try to escape the aliens! I build this application taking CS61B. 

I developed a local application which is game where you try to escape the aliens.

**Rules to the Game**
* Escape the cave: Collect all the dabloons and find your way to the exit door.
* Don't touch the aliens: They will kill you. Player has 2 lives.
* Laser Gun: Blast the aliens and send them back to their spawn point
* Invisibility: Step 50 steps unnoticed by the aliens!

**Features**
* Random room generation with seed
* Aliens use fully implemented A* algorithm to track the player
* Implements a variety of basic data structures (Priority Queue, MinHeap, etc.) in this project.

Overall, this was a great project to learn the fundamentals of data structures!
